v1 = vec [2,7,1] 
v2 = vec [8,2,8]
\end{code}

example matrix from a list of lists

\begin{code}
m1 :: Matrix Double 4 4
m1 = toMat [[1,0,0,3],[2,0,8,0],[3,0,3,1],[4,0,2,0]]
\end{code}

using key value pairs to create the same matrix,
useful for creating larger sparse matrices

\begin{code}
m2 :: Matrix Double 4 4
m2 = fromKeyValue [(1,1,1),(1,2,2),(1,3,3),(1,4,4),
                    (3,2,8),(3,3,3),(3,4,2),
                    (4,1,3),(4,3,1)]
\end{code}

changeRep can be used to convert any matrix representation to another.
However this keeps zeroes

\begin{code}
m3 :: CSR Double 4 4
m3 = changeRep m1 
\end{code}


toSparse does the same thing as changeRep 
but removes zeros before reconstructing

\begin{code}
m4 :: CSR Double 4 4
m4 = toSparse m1 
\end{code}

fromKeyValue can also be used to 
make any matrix representation directly

\begin{code}
m5 :: CSR Double 4 4
m5 = fromKeyValue [(1,1,1),(1,2,2),(1,3,3),(1,4,4),
                    (3,2,8),(3,3,3),(3,4,2),
                    (4,1,3),(4,3,1)]
\end{code}

Likewise the same can be done
to create a QuadTree sparse matrix

\begin{code}
m6 :: QuadM Double 4 4
m6 = toSparse m1 

m7 :: QuadM Double 4 4
m7 = fromKeyValue [(1,1,1),(1,2,2),(1,3,3),(1,4,4),
                    (3,2,8),(3,3,3),(3,4,2),
                    (4,1,3),(4,3,1)]
\end{code}
